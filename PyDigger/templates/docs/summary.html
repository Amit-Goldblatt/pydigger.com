        <h2>Adding Summary</h2>
        Each package can have a field called <b>summary</b> that contains the short description of the package.
        The most common way to include it in the packages is to add a field called <b>description</b> to the the <b>setup</b> function in the <b>setup.py</b> of the project.
        (Not to be confused with the <b>long_description</b>.)
        <p>
        In <b>setup</b> use the field <b>description</b> to provide a one-line description that will become the <b>summary</b> field in the JSON file.<br>
        In <b>setup</b> use the field <b>long_descrption</b> to provide, well, a long description that will become the <b>description</b> field in the JSON file.
