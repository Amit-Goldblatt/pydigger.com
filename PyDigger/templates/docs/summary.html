        <h2>Adding Summary</h2>
        Adding the <b>summary</b> is technically very similar to adding the <a href="author">author field</a>, but knowing what to write is a bit more challenging.
        You'll have to understand what is the project about and you must be able to write a one-line description.
        <p>
        Alternatively you can locate the bug-tracking system of the project (they are usually the same place the version control system can be found) and you can open
        a ticket or issue depending the word the particular system uses.
        <p>
        <h2>The technical details</h2>
        The JSON file of each package can have a field called <b>summary</b> that contains the short description of the package.
        The most common way to include it in the packages is to add a field called <b>description</b> to the <b>setup</b> function in the <b>setup.py</b> of the project.
        (Not to be confused with the <b>long_description</b>.)
        <p>
        In <b>setup</b> use the field <b>description</b> to provide a one-line description that will become the <b>summary</b> field in the JSON file.<br>
        In <b>setup</b> use the field <b>long_descrption</b> to provide, well, a long description that will become the <b>description</b> field in the JSON file.
        <p>
        Yes, I know the naming is a bit confusing.
