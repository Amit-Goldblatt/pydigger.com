        <h2>Background</h2>
        The Pydigger site monitors the uploads to <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a> and collects meta-data about the packages.
        It shows various <a href="/stats">statistics</a> and points you to packages that could be improved by adding some simple meta-data to them.
        One of the easiste to fix is the missing <b>author</b> field.

        <h2>Adding Author</h2>
        Each package can have a field called <b>author</b> that contains the name of, well the author. Accourding to our stats about
        4.6% of the packages <a href="/search/no-author">have not author field</a>. About 1% <a href="/search/has-vcs-no-author">has VCS but no author field</a>
        making them very easy to fix. (Locating the missing VCS-es (ak Version Control System) will be the material of another post.
        <p>
        The most common way to include it in the package is to add a field called <b>author</b> to the <b>setup</b> function in the <b>setup.py</b> of the project.
        In the video we checked the <a href="https://pydigger.com/pypi/eririn">eririn</a> project to see how it is done
        and then fixed the <a href="https://pydigger.com/pypi/arduino-udev">arduino-udev</a> project.
        This is the <a href="https://github.com/strawlab/arduino-udev/pull/4">pull request</a> you can see in the video.
        Within a few minutes the Pull-request was accepted.
        <p>
        Here is the section of the setup.py file:
        <pre>
            author="Foo Bar",
        </pre>

        <p>
        Another project <a href="https://github.com/vangheem/mr.flagly/">mr.flagly</a> was using a <b>pyproject.toml</b> file which is <a href="https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/">documented here</a>.
        I sent the <a href="https://github.com/vangheem/mr.flagly/pull/1">pull-request</a> from another account  I was demonstrating it to the <a href="https://osdc.code-maven.com/">OSDC</a> students.
        <p>
        Here is the section of the pyproject.toml files:
        <pre>
        authors = [
            "Foo Bar &lt;foo@bar.com&gt;",
        ]
        </pre>
        <h2>Step you can do:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Visit the <a href="/search/has-vcs-no-author">list of packages that have VCS but no author field</a> and pick one.</li>
            <li>Visit the source code of the package. (Link is on the page of the package)</li>
            <li>In the VCS (Github, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc. look for the name of the author of the package.</li>
            <li>Locate the <b>setup.py</b> in the root of the repository</li>
            <li>Edit the file and add the <b>author</b> field.</li>
            <li>Save it. (This creates a commit)</li>
            <li>Send a Pull-Request</li>
        </ul>
